## Introduction

Internet Relay Chat is a text communication protocol on the Internet. It is primarily used for instant communication in the form of group discussions through discussion channels, but can also be used for direct communication between two people.

IRC clients connect to IRC servers to access channels. IRC servers are connected to each other to create networks.
